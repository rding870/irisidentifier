# Logistic Regression on the Kaggle Iris Dataset

Hi there! 👋  

I recently completed the [**Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification**](https://www.coursera.org/) course on Coursera. To put my learning into practice, I decided to apply logistic regression to the **Kaggle Iris Dataset**.

Most of the machine learning code is inspired by the concepts and implementations covered in the Coursera course, and full credit goes to them for the foundational material. 🌟

### Key Features
- Implemented logistic regression from scratch.
- Explored the Iris dataset for classification tasks.
- Gained hands-on experience applying machine learning concepts to real-world datasets.

### Getting Started
To try it out on your own:
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-link>
   ```
2. Install the required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook logistic_regression_iris.ipynb
   ```

### Dataset
The Kaggle Iris dataset is used in this project, which contains features and labels for classifying different Iris flower species.

### Acknowledgments
This project is inspired by the concepts learned in the **Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification** course on Coursera. A huge thanks to the course creators for their excellent tutorials!
